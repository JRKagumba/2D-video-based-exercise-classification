## 💰 What You Can Sell

**PoseLab Starter Pack - $29**

**Value Proposition:**
- 137 unique exercise videos → You can't get this anywhere else
- 86% accuracy models → Ready to use immediately
- Complete pipeline → Learn the full process
- Research quality → Academic-grade code

**Market:**
- Students learning computer vision
- Researchers needing motion data
- Developers building fitness apps
- Educators teaching pose estimation

---

## 🎯 The Strategic Advantage

**Your Innovation:** Don't solve 3D. Learn movement patterns.

Traditional approaches fail because 2D→3D reconstruction is too noisy. Your approach calculates temporal features from joint angles and trains XGBoost on domain-specific patterns.

**Result:** 86% accuracy, robust to camera noise, works with any video.

**This is your differentiator.** Market it heavily.
